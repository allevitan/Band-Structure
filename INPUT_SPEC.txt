The input will be provided via a json file which must contain the following key-value pairs:

REV 1 will aim to accept:

"Z": the atomic number of the atom in question
"lattice constant": in units of bohr radii, the lattice constant 

and will assume that the lattice is a diamond-lattice.

REV 2 (if ever reached) will aim to accept (subject to change):

"Z": the atomic number of the atom in question
"lattice constants": in units of bohr radii, an object with keys "a","b",and "c", each containing the length of one direction of the primitive cell.
"primitive transformations":  a list of lists representing the appropriate primitive translations, to be scaled by the lattice constants
"positions": a list of lists representing the positions of atoms within the unit cell, to be scaled by the lattice constants.
