The input will be provided via a json file which must contain the following key-value pairs:

"name": the name of the crystal being described
"solver": the name of the solver to use - currently, "central" is the only accepted input
"atoms": a dictionary with keys that represent the atomic number and values that represent the positions of all atoms with that atomic number, in units of the lattice constants.
"lattice constants": in units of bohr radii, an object with keys "a","b",and "c", each containing the length of one direction of the primitive cell.
"primitive transforms":  a list of lists representing the appropriate primitive translations, to be scaled by the lattice constants

Example input (Diamond.json):

{
    "name": "Diamond",
    "solver": "central",
    "atoms": {
        "6": [[0,0,0],
              [0.25,0.25,0.25]]
    },
    "lattice constants": {
        "a": 10.3,
        "b": 10.3,
        "c": 10.3
    },
    "primitive transforms": [
        [0.5,0.5,0],
        [0.5,0,0.5],
        [0,0.5,0.5]
    ]
}
