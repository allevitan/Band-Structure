The input will be provided via a json file which must contain the following key-value pairs:

"name": the name of the crystal being described
"atoms": a list of objects, each with keys "Z" and "loc". "Z" contains the atomic number of the atom at location "loc" - loc is in units of the lattice constants.
"lattice constants": in units of bohr radii, an object with keys "a","b",and "c", each containing the length of one direction of the primitive cell.
"primitive transforms":  a list of lists representing the appropriate primitive translations, to be scaled by the lattice constants

Example input:

{
    "name": Diamond
    "atoms": [
        {
            "Z": 6
            "loc": [0,0,0]
        },
        {
            "Z": 6
            "loc": [0.25,0.25,0.25]
        }
    ],
    "lattice constants": {
        "a": 10.3,
        "b": 10.3,
        "c": 10.3
    },
    "primitive transforms": [
        [0.5,0.5,0],
        [0.5,0,0.5],
        [0,0.5,0.5]
    ]
}
